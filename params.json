{"name":"esxi-safe-shutdown","tagline":"ESXi safe shutdown script","body":"### What is it?\r\nA tool for VMware ESXi servers to safely shutdown all running VMs (even ones that don't have VMware Tools installed), before powering off the ESXi host.\r\n\r\n### Where will it work?\r\nI've tested it with ESXi 5.1, it'll probably work with 5.0 as well but I haven't tried that. I don't think it'll work \r\non 4.x though. Let me know how you get on!\r\n\r\n### Author and Contributors\r\nAaron B. Russell (@arussell)\r\n\r\n### Reporting problems\r\nUse the issue tracker. Pull requests are welcome, though please remember that ESXi doesn't run `bash` so ensure your code is compatible with basic `sh`.\r\n\r\n### Inspired by\r\nhttp://thehelpfulhacker.net/2012/11/02/graceful-ups-shutdowns-for-your-esxi-server-with-centos/\r\n\r\n### License\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Aaron B.
