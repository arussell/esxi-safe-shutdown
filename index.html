<a name="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h3>

<p>A tool for VMware ESXi servers to safely shutdown all running VMs (even ones that don't have VMware Tools installed), before powering off the ESXi host.</p>

<h3>
<a name="where-will-it-work" class="anchor" href="#where-will-it-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where will it work?</h3>

<p>I've tested it with ESXi 5.1, it'll probably work with 5.0 as well but I haven't tried that. I don't think it'll work 
on 4.x though. Let me know how you get on!</p>

<p>Use the issue tracker. Pull requests are welcome, though please remember that ESXi doesn't run <code>bash</code> so ensure your code is compatible with basic <code>sh</code>.</p>
